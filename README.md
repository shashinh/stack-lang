# stack-lang
A language built on Racket that simulates the working of the Postfix notation

## Purpose
A start to learning the practical aspects of Programming Language development. This simple implementation follows the tutorial, and results in a language that simulates the working on the Postfix expression notation.

### To run
Install the DrRacket suite, clone the repo and simply execute the stack-lang.rkt test driver file.

For example, for the following contents of the test driver file:

4
8
+
5
*

the output will be (4+8)*5 = 60
